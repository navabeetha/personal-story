Repository for the assignment on Personal Data Stories.

I don't really spend much money. A few years of working as an Arhitect has numbed me to the pleasures of rampant consumerism. At the same time, my bank account does not reflect the amazing (to me) savings I should have reaped over those years. How is this possible? Where am I spending all that money if I am not buying things?

I would like to use the data retrieved from my internet banking to try and piece out my expenditures and if possible, figure out what are the things I spend the most money on and why.

Limitation - The bank statement has no way of showing my expenses in cash. Hence for the time being I will bin all ATM Cash withdrawals together as a single group of unaccounted for expenditure.
